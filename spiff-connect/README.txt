The Spiff 3D Product Customizer plugin allows you to use Spiff3D with WooCommerce.

Spiff allows you to visually personalize products in 3D and AR.

Being able to visualize the finished, personalized product to your customer prior to purchase is a powerful way of reducing pre-purchase risk perceptions and therefore cart abandonment.

Using a 3D model, customers an interact with your products using the mouse (desktop) or fingers (mobile).

Spiff takes 3D product renders to the next level, allowing you to dynamically customise the product in real-time.

This is especially useful if your store offers products which have customization and personalization options. In these cases, in the past, it has been difficult to visually represent these products to the customer.
